The updated shader includes all the usual lighting components — ambient, diffuse, specular, light, color, intensity, reflection, and even gamma. So what's likely making the result look darker and duller isn't that something's missing, but that some of these components may be weighted too low or combined differently than in your original.

Possible causes:

Ambient light might be set too low — leading to an overall darker scene.

Specular highlights might be underemphasized — making surfaces appear flat.

Gamma correction may be missing or applied incorrectly — making everything look muddy.

Reflection blending could be overtaking the base video texture, dimming the output.

Final color output might be clamped, darkened, or not normalized.

If you'd like, I can dive in deeper and point to the exact lines affecting this — or help restore the visual punch it used to have. Want me to do that?

Here are some key code snippets from your shader that are likely contributing to the scene appearing darker or duller, along with explanations for each. These are preserved exactly as written — no changes made — and each is wrapped in a <div> as requested:

<div><code>fragColor = vec4(pow(radiance(ray) * exposure, vec3(1.0 / gamma)), 1.0);</code></div>
Explanation:
This is your final output color. The pow(..., 1.0 / gamma) is applying gamma correction, and multiplying by exposure beforehand. If either radiance(ray) returns a low value or exposure is small, this will make everything dim. Overuse of gamma correction can also mute colors.

<div><code>gamma = 2.2;</code></div>
Explanation:
This gamma value is common for monitor correction, but depending on how you're blending light, this could be making the image unnecessarily dark if your colors are already linearized.

<div><code>pow(1.0 - hv, 5.0);</code></div>
Explanation:
This is probably a Fresnel term or a highlight fade function. The power of 5.0 is steep, which could be limiting reflection brightness to very narrow angles only, dulling specular effects.

<div><code>pow(abs(dot(ray.direction, light.direction)), 250.0);</code></div>
Explanation:
This is a very sharp specular reflection (shininess exponent of 250), which can be realistic for polished surfaces — but it might make the highlights so tight they’re barely visible.

<div><code>pow(l, 2.0) - dot(oc, oc) + pow(sphere.radius, 2.0);</code></div>
Explanation:
This looks like part of a ray-sphere intersection calculation. It’s probably not causing darkness directly, but it can affect what gets rendered and when, especially if the math is tuned tightly.

<div><code>pow(radiance(ray) * exposure, vec3(1.0 / gamma)), 1.0);</code></div>
Explanation:
Same as the first line above, reinforcing how gamma and exposure dominate your final color. If radiance is low or under-calculated upstream, everything stays dark no matter what.

<div><code>vec3 color = vec3(0.);</code></div>
Explanation:
Starting color at black is common, but if your lighting or surface contributions don’t add up to enough brightness, you end up with that "dull" look.

Summary of What's Likely Missing:
Radiance return values might be too low due to weak lighting or reflection logic upstream.

Specular reflections are extremely tight and might barely register visually.

Gamma and exposure may be clamping rather than enhancing your output.

Ambient light or bounce light contribution appears minimal or missing — adding even a basic ambient term would help lift shadowy areas.
