I've altered for learning and vibe coding stupidity. 
What I learned AI is getting serioiusly close to guiding the IDIOTs like me. 
It would really help I actaully knew something about shaders.
But evey now and then even a a crazy squirrel like me can find a nut and keep AI on a path.  It's hard but somewhat possible??
